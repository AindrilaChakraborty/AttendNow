### Running an Angular UI Application

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Angular project directory:
     ```
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

   

3. **Install Dependencies**:
  ```
     cd ui
     ```
   - Run `npm install` to install project dependencies specified in `package.json`.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - After installing dependencies, you can run the Angular application using Angular CLI.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     ng serve
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (or the address shown in the terminal) to access your Angular application.
