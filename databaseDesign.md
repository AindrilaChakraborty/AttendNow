### Database Design

#### Tables:
1. **Students**:
   - StudentID (Primary Key)
   - Name
   - Email
   - (Other relevant student information)

2. **Courses**:
   - CourseID (Primary Key)
   - CourseName
   - Instructor
   - (Other relevant course information)

3. **Attendance**:
   - AttendanceID (Primary Key)
   - StudentID (Foreign Key referencing Students table)
   - CourseID (Foreign Key referencing Courses table)
   - Date
   - Status (Present/Absent)

#### Relationships:
- One-to-Many relationship between Students and Attendance (One student can have multiple attendance records).
- One-to-Many relationship between Courses and Attendance (One course can have multiple attendance records).
```
Students ------< Attendance >----- Courses
   |                                     |
   |                                     |
   ---------------------------------------
```


In the ER diagram:
- `<` indicates a One-to-Many relationship.
- `-----` indicates a relationship line.
- `Students` and `Courses` are connected to `Attendance` through One-to-Many relationships, signifying that one student can have multiple attendance records, and one course can have multiple attendance records.

**Notes:**
- The `Students` table stores information about individual students enrolled in courses.
- The `Courses` table contains details about the courses being offered, including the instructor's name.
- The `Attendance` table records attendance data, including the date, status (whether the student is present or absent), and references to the corresponding student and course via foreign keys.
- This design allows for efficient management of attendance records for multiple students across various courses.
